# House_Prices_Prediction
This is one of the "Getting started" projects from kaggle in which we want to predict the house prices with some regressors.
Here is the link to the project description: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques
Here is the overview of the steps presented in "House_Price_prediction_2.ipynb":
1) Data cleaning, data exploration, data analysis
2) Feature engineering
3) Running Lasso Regression, SVM, RF, XGB and CAT Boost Models
4) CAT Boost has the best performance out of the mentioned models
5) Making the prediction with CAT Boost regressor and submit the result to the kaggle with score: 0.12883 (the lower the better)
